Thank you for taking the time to review my Module 4 Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz Challenge. I have spent a lot of time working and reworking this app. There are several other repositories that I have included the link to. The repo's were my other numerous attempts at completing this project. I will continue to work on this app based off of your feedback. Thank you again for taking the time to view my submission and for providing such detailed feedback.
