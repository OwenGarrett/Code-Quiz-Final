Thank you for taking the time to review my Module 4 Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz Challenge. I have spent a lot of time working and reworking this app. I have made several attempts,including the repository link here (https://github.com/Sheogorath9/Web-APIs-Challenge-Code-Quiz), that did not work. I have restarted this project several times and I thank you for the feedback provided on each submission. Again, thank you for using my application.
